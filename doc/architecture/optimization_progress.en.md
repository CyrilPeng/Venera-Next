## P0: Tooling and quality baseline (2026-09-30)

- Starting revision: `550fcff`. Existing reader menu locking, long-press auto-reading pause, settings/tests, README and translation changes participate in working-tree tests but are excluded from this phase's commit.
- Flutter tests with fresh coverage: 579 passed, no failures; fresh line coverage 34.62% (10018/28938).
- Analysis after excluding generated `build/` output: no errors/warnings, 24 infos. Two errors and one info originated in generated output.
- Existing Python suite: 44 tests, 3 skipped. Seven additional dependency-checker tests cover conditional/relative/package references, parts, comments/strings, transitive UI exports, new edges and cycle detection.
- CI rejects new feature dependencies. The current aggregate component includes comic_details, favorites, history, local_comics, reader, search and sync. It includes UI navigation and is not proof of a business-only cycle.
- `dependency_baseline.json` records existing edges and UI files. Business entry points will be enrolled as they migrate; none are enrolled yet.
- Local generated logs are under `output/architecture-*.log` and are not committed.

### Pending device validation

Quality baselines and tooling are complete; actual-device performance and five-platform builds remain unverified. Before P5, fix devices, profile/release modes and synthetic fixtures; repeat chapter transitions, seeking and long-image scrolling at least three times and record elapsed/frame times and peak memory. Before P6, measure directory scans, synchronization and imports.

Compare identical devices/fixtures and establish natural variance before choosing regression thresholds. Suite runtime is not UI performance. Other-platform validation requires the corresponding runner/device and remains unverified until executed.

## Later phases

P1–P8 are pending. Update this record and CHANGELOG for each verified work unit and commit separately while preserving existing local feature changes.
